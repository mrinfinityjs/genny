# Genny - General Purpose Community Discord bot.

This is a powerful and highly configurable Discord bot built with Node.js and Discord.js. It's designed to automate server management, boost community engagement, and provide a suite of utility functions for moderators and members alike.

The bot features a persistent data system using a local `data.json` file, ensuring that user activity, reminders, and other crucial information survive bot restarts.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üìä Activity Tracking & Pruning:** Monitors user messages in a designated channel and can automatically run polls to kick inactive members.
*   **‚úÖ New Member Verification:** A robust system to automatically poll for the verification of new members once they meet configurable activity and tenure requirements.
*   **üìù Persistent Reminders:** A `!remindme` command that understands natural language (e.g., "in 10 days," "tomorrow at 5pm") and persists through restarts.
*   **üé• YouTube Integration:**
    *   Automatically logs all YouTube links posted in the server.
    *   Creates manual or automated polls to decide which video to watch as a group.
    *   Lists recently posted videos based on various criteria.
*   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Features (via Google Gemini):**
    *   **`!ai` command:** Allows users to have a conversation with the AI.
    *   **`!positivity` command:** Generates an uplifting message.
    *   **On-Demand Translation:** Translates a message to a configured language when a user reacts with a specific emoji.
*   **üè∑Ô∏è Tagging System:** A key-value storage system for server members to save and retrieve useful snippets of text.
*   **‚≠ê Reaction-Based Actions:**
    *   **Reaction Roles:** Assigns roles to users when they react to a specific message.
    *   **Message Bookmarking:** Lets users save a message to their DMs by reacting with an `üçé` emoji.
    *   **Knowledge Base:** Automatically copies important or funny messages to a designated channel based on reactions.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Configuration:** Moderators can view and update many of the bot's settings in real-time without needing to restart the bot.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Node.js:** Version 16.9.0 or higher.
2.  **npm:** (Node Package Manager) usually comes with Node.js.
3.  **A Discord Bot Application:**
    *   Create one on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    *   You will need the **Bot Token**.
    *   Enable the **Privileged Gateway Intents**: `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT` and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.
4.  **A Google API Key:**
    *   This is required for the AI (Gemini) and YouTube (oEmbed) features.
    *   Create one on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You will need to enable the "Generative Language API" and "YouTube Data API v3".

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command in your terminal to install all required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install `discord.js`, `luxon`, `axios`, `cron`, `ytdl-core`, and `chrono-node`.

3.  **Create the Configuration File:**
    In the root directory of the project, create a file named `config.json`. Copy the contents of the `config.example.json` file (or the template below) into it.

4.  **Fill out `config.json`:**
    This is the most important step. Carefully fill in all the required values, especially your bot token, guild ID, and API keys. See the **Configuration** section below for a detailed explanation of each setting.

5.  **Run the Bot:**
    Start the bot using the following command:
    ```bash
    node bot.js
    ```
    If you want the bot to run continuously, consider using a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).
